        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          For a recent data analysis project, I developed a Sales Dashboard
          using Tableau to analyze and visualize sales performance. The
          objective of the project was to provide stakeholders with an
          interactive tool to track key performance indicators (KPIs), identify
          trends, and compare sales data across different product categories and
          geographical regions. My contributions included gathering and
          preparing the data from multiple sources, including sales, customer,
          and product data, and performing data modeling to establish
          relationships between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used Tableau to create various visualizations, including bar-in-bar
          charts, sparklines, and KPIs, to display sales trends and comparisons
          effectively. I implemented interactive elements, such as dynamic
          filters and parameters, which allowed users to adjust the dashboard
          based on specific criteria like time periods and product categories.
          This ensured that stakeholders could conduct tailored analysis
          according to their needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I focused on ensuring high data quality and accuracy by
          thoroughly cleaning and validating the datasets before connecting them
          to Tableau. I also employed efficient dashboard layout strategies to
          make the user interface intuitive and aligned with the companyâ€™s
          branding. This project helped me hone my skills in data visualization,
          data modeling, and user-centered design.
